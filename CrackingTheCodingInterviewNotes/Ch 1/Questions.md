<h1> Chapter One Questions </h1>

<h2> 1.1 Is Unique </h2>
<p> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures? </p>

<h2> 1.2 Check Permutation </h2>
<p> Given two string, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.</p>

<h2> 1.3 URLify </h2>
<p> Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. </p>

<h2> 1.4 Palindrome Permutation </h2>
<p> Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwrd and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and none-letter characters. </p>
<h3> Example </h3>
<p> Input: Tact Coa </p>
<p> Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.) </p>

<h2> 1.5 One Away </h2>
<p> There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. </p>
<h3> Example </h3>
<p> pale, ple -> true </p>
<p> pales, pale -> true </p>
<p> pale, bale -> true </p>
<p> pale, bake -> false </p>

<h2> 1.6 String Compression </h2>
<p> Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string <code>aabcccccaa</code> would become <code>a2b1c5a3</code>. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z). </p>

<h2> 1.7 Rotate Matrix </h2>
<p> Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? </p>

<h2> 1.8 Zero Matrix </h2>
<p> Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. </p>

<h2> 1.9 String Rotation </h2>
<p> Assume you have a method <code>isSubstring</code> which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>, write code to check if <code>s2</code> is a rotation of <code>s1</code> using only one call to <code>isSubstring</code> (e.g. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"). </p>
